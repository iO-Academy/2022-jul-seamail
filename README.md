# SeaMail
### Description
SeaMail is a React JS project, styled  with Sass and Bootstrap, that consumes an API and acts as the front end for an email client. Modern JavaScript practices were followed throughout including using the fetch API alongside React Hooks to create performant rendering. 

Browse through read and unread emails in the inbox, send new emails to multiple addresses and then view them in the sent box. New email fields are validated and sanitised. The read/unread status of inbox items are updated dynamically.
